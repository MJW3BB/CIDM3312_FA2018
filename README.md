Assignment Six

Please write a simple ASP.NET MVC Core application that serves as a unit converter.  Please convert between the following unit types:

    Temperatures - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
    Length - Meters, Feet, Yards
    Mass - Ounce, Pound, Gram, Kilogram

This will consist of a simple controller.  You will use query string parameters to send the units and unit data into the controller to get a web page response (for now, there is NO UI Input)
