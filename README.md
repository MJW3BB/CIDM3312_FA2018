In-Class Practice HTTP GET with ASP.NET MVC Routes and Controllers

    Create a new ASP.NET MVC Core project called MyWebCalculator
    Create a new ASP.NET MVC Controller called CalculatorController
    Create Action Methods for Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, Ceiling, and Floor
    All of the above must be implemented in a separate class library
    You will reference the DLL only in your MVC project (yay)
    Create the required parameters for each of the above methods
    Each method should return a string containing a phrase/sentence indicating the operands given and the result of the operation
    From a browser, call each method using the appropriate url route and arguments

Download and copy the MathRoutines.dll file to the root of C:\ in order for everything to work properly.
