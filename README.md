Assignment Seven

Please write a simple ASP.NET MVC Core application that serves as a unit converter.  Please convert between the following unit types:

    Temperatures - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
    Length - Meters, Feet, Yards
    Mass - Ounce, Pound, Gram, Kilogram

This will consist of a simple controller.  You will use an HTML form, expressed in a Razor template, to HTTP POST the data base to the controller. Then, when the calculation is complete, we will redirect to show the results in a separate template page.
